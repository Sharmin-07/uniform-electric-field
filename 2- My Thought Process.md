This repository began with a simple confusion — one that refused to leave my mind.

The phrase “uniform electric field” appeared too casually in my studies, especially in the context of infinite charged sheets and parallel plate capacitors. The formulas were clear: the electric field does not depend on distance. But that immediately felt unsettling. In almost every other situation involving electric fields, distance plays a central role. So why does it suddenly stop mattering here?

At first, I accepted the standard explanation: the plates are infinitely large. But that felt like a statement rather than an understanding. It explained what happens, but not why it happens.

What truly triggered my curiosity was this:
If I move farther away from a charged sheet, the distance increases — and increasing distance should weaken the field. Yet the electric field remains constant. That means something must be compensating for this weakening. That idea stayed with me.

Thinking about it more carefully, I realised that as we move away from the sheet, although each small patch of charge contributes less to the electric field, the number of patches contributing effectively increases. The weakening of individual contributions and the growth in the number of contributors balance each other exactly. That was the first moment when the idea genuinely clicked.

Once this made sense, the parallel plate capacitor became clearer as well. Even though the distances from the two plates change as one moves between them, the same balancing mechanism operates again. The constancy of the electric field is not accidental — it is enforced by geometry and symmetry.

This naturally led me to think about real plates. They are not infinite. So what breaks? That question led me to edge (fringe) fields — and eventually to the realisation that fringe fields are not an additional complication, but the physical consequence of broken symmetry. When the infinite symmetry disappears, the perfect cancellation disappears with it.

At that point, I realised this topic was no longer just about a formula. It was about what uniform really means, why ideal models work so well, and how symmetry influences physical behaviour.

This repository is my attempt to organise that understanding — not merely to state results, but to explain why those results make sense. I studied this idea because I wanted to truly feel the physics, not just apply it. Everything here comes from that curiosity.
