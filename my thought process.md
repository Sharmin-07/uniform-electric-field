I tend to notice small things that don’t immediately make sense to me and try to understand them. I was confused by why electric potential is taken as zero at infinity in electrostatics, but at Earth in circuit problems. Looking into it made me realize that mathematics is flexible—the same concept can be framed differently depending on the context without changing the underlying physics. Writing this helped me organize my thoughts and reinforced my habit of exploring small questions until they make sense.
