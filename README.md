# uniform-electric-field
An intuitive exploration of what a uniform electric field is, why it can be independent of position, and when real physical systems can be approximated as uniform.


# About Me:-
I'm Sharmin Nabab.
I'm currently a high school student.
My interests span mathematics and physics. I also enjoy coding and am currently learning Python.
I like to break down concepts and rebuild ideas as if explaining to my younger self, often through a first-principles approach.

I upload these notes because I know how difficult it can be to find clear, intuitive explanations when you’re genuinely curious about why something works. Each repository contains my questions, reasoning, and final understanding, written so others can follow the same path with less friction. This space is both a record of my learning and an attempt to make that process more accessible to anyone who thinks the same way.
