A uniform electric field is defined as an electric field whose magnitude and direction remain the same at every point in a region of space. The electric field due to a single, infinitely large thin charged sheet comes out to be

E = $\frac{\sigma}{2 \varepsilon_0}$

using the appropriate limits from Coulomb’s law, where $\sigma$ is the surface charge density of the sheet, and $\varepsilon_0$ is the electric permittivity of free space. Notice that this expression is independent of the distance from the sheet. But, why? In every other situation we have studied, the electric field depends on distance. Point charges, spherical shells, extended distributions — the field decreases with increasing distance. So why doesn’t the field of an infinite sheet behave the same way?

Let’s try to see it from the field-line perspective. When the source of the electric field is a point charge, the field lines spread out radially. Take a small imaginary rectangle perpendicular to the direction of propagation of any one field line, near the charge. Some field lines pass through this rectangle. Now, as we move this rectangle away from the point charge, the number of field lines passing through it decreases. Field lines are almost never parallel; they diverge, curve, or converge depending on the source. But in a uniform electric field, the lines are drawn straight, parallel, and equally spaced. Take a small imaginary rectangle perpendicular to these lines anywhere between the plates or near the sheet. Notice that the same number of field lines passes through it, no matter where it is placed. That tells us the field strength is the same everywhere. But again, this does not explain why. In fact, it reinforces the question: what is physically causing this invariance?

Imagine an infinitely large, charged sheet. Let's take this sheet as being made up of infinitely many infinitesimal surface patches, each contributing a tiny electric field at the point of observation. Consider a point at some finite distance from it. As we move farther away from the plate, from this point, intuition suggests that the field should weaken because the distance from each infinitesimal patch of charge on the sheet is increasing. But something else happens at the same time: as we move away, a larger portion of the sheet contributes effectively. The weakening of each patch is exactly balanced by the increase in the number of contributing patches. The geometry and symmetry of the sheet ensure this perfect balance. The result is a field that is constant everywhere, not because we assume it, but because the physics of infinite geometry naturally produces it.

Now consider two infinitely large, oppositely charged parallel plates separated by a finite distance. The electric field in the region between them comes out to be

E = $\frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0}$,

where $\sigma$ is the surface charge density on each plate, and $\varepsilon_0$ is the electric permittivity of free space. Consider an electron released near the negatively charged plate and allowed to move toward the positively charged plate.

At any instant, the electron experiences force due to both plates. As it moves away from the negatively charged plate, its distance from that plate increases, so the contribution from any individual patch of charge on that plate weakens. At the same time, however, a larger area of the plate effectively contributes to the force, because more charge patches fall within comparable distances. These two effects compensate each other exactly.

Simultaneously, as the electron moves closer to the positively charged plate, each contributing patch of that plate exerts a stronger force due to reduced distance, but the number of patches that contribute significantly decreases in precisely the right way. At every point between the plates, the weakening and strengthening of contributions from both plates balance out. The electron therefore experiences the same net force at every position between the plates, leading to constant acceleration.

What matters here is not the electron’s position, but the symmetry of the charge distribution. The uniform electric field is not a consequence of placing the electron in a special region; it arises because the symmetry and geometry of two infinite plates ensure the balance of contributions everywhere between them.
Understanding this ideal case is more than a mathematical exercise. It reveals how geometry and symmetry control the behaviour of electric fields. It explains why uniform fields exist, why real systems can be treated as nearly uniform, and where the idealization begins to fail. Ultimately, a uniform electric field is not just a diagram or a formula; it is a demonstration of how perfect symmetry naturally produces uniformity.
Of course, real plates are finite, so perfect symmetry is broken at the edges. Near the boundaries, field lines no longer remain straight and parallel; they bend outward, and the field strength begins to decrease. These deviations are known as fringe effects. However, when the separation between the plates is very small compared to their lateral dimensions, there exists a large central region where the influence of the edges is negligible. In this central region, the symmetry is almost perfectly preserved, and the electric field is nearly uniform.
Notice that this uniformity is strongest at the exact middle between the plates. As one moves closer to either edge, the balance of contributions from the charge distribution begins to break down. The absence of symmetry near the boundaries causes the field lines to spread out, increasing non-uniformity. In this way, the infinite-plate model does not deny the existence of edge effects; instead, it tells us where the approximation holds and why it works so well in practical setups.


# Short Version

The electric field of an infinite charged sheet is independent of distance because two effects exactly balance each other. As we move farther from the sheet, the force due to each infinitesimal patch of charge weakens with distance, but at the same time, a larger area of the sheet contributes significantly to the field. These two effects compensate perfectly due to the symmetry and infinite extent of the sheet, resulting in a constant electric field everywhere.

For two infinitely large, oppositely charged parallel plates, the same symmetry applies, which leads to a uniform electric field and constant acceleration of a charge placed between the plates.

Uniform electric fields therefore arise not by assumption, but as a consequence of symmetry and geometry. Real plates are finite, so this symmetry breaks near the edges, producing fringe effects. However, when the plate separation is much smaller than their dimensions, a large central region exists where the field is nearly uniform, explaining why the ideal model works so well in practice.
